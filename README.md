# The Brazil Discord Bot

## Initializing
- Make a copy of `example.env` and name it `.env`
- `MONGODB_URI` needs to be updated with a proper `URI`
- Insert your own `TEST_BOT_TOKEN` by going [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications), selecting your application, going to `Bot` and copying the token

## Developing
- Make sure to run `npm i` with the node LTS
- Run the bot with `npm run dev`
- Before committing execute `npm run lint` and resolve any errors
